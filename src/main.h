/*! \mainpage Welcome to the documentation for PEPSI's.
 *
 * \section intro_sec About this application.
 *
 * PEPSI's has been developed as part of a research internship in the <a href="http://www.inria.fr/equipes/vr4i">IRISA-Inria VR4i</a> project team in Rennes, France. The main developer is Steve Dodier-Lazaro, who worked under the supervision of Val√©rie Gouranton and Quentin Avril. It is currently not available for download and is the exclusive property of Inria Rennes, but a release of a final prototype will be made if given the occasion.
 *
 * \section install_sec Building PEPSI's
 *
 * You will need the following dependencies installed: Qt, Bullet Physics, Ogre 3D, Blitz++, Boost, Qxt. The libraries and include files of all dependencies should be reachable by Qt Creator. If one of them is missing, please edit the .pro file attached to this project, and set INCLUDEPATH and LIBS to appropriate values.
 * Please use qmake and then make to build PEPSI's outside of Qt Creator. You may need to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable at runtime to be able to run the application.
 *
 * Note that the Blitz++ Fedora 16 package misses some code headers, and you may need to manually install them to build PEPSI's.
 *
 * \section status_sec Current status
 * There are currently no active developers for PEPSI's. It is at the moment capable of detecting collisions in a distributed fashion, but constraint solving between objects managed by different processors has not yet been implemented, and a few bugs remain to be fixed. Parallel/Distributed constraint solving may be more efficient/clever with a different granularity than the one chosen in PEPSI's and version 1 of the SODA framework, and a proposal will be issued for the development of this component.
 *
 * \section report_bugs Reporting a bug
 * If you are in-house, please write a bug report in the Inria GForge page of the project (https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=13788&group_id=4142&func=browse), or email <a href="mailto:valerie.gouranton@inria.fr">the project head</a> in last resort for her to dispatch the bug report to current developers (specifying [SODA-BUGS] at the start of the mail subject). Steve has the technical know-how about the project and can be reached at <a href="mailto:steve.dodier@ensi-bourges.fr">his school mail address</a>. Same mail subject rules apply.
